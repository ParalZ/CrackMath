## Project Structure

## Getting Started

## Future Development
- make sure to promise only the needed scripts by the lessonloader not all of them as not all of them are needed one by one
- add css dynamically
- hide the website before everything is loaded. and show it only when everything is loaded
- understand fully lessonLoader.js
